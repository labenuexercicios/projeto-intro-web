# INTRODUCTION, INSTALLATION, AND COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS
##########

So, there aren't many Naruto fonts out (no other, to my knowledge at 
the time of this writing) there. I, realizing that, created my own! 
I call the masterpiece, Ninja Naruto! Yes, it's a Naruto font.

Ninja Naruto will not completely make Naruto text like the Naruto 
logo itself. If you want to do so, there are 2 ways to do it.

First way, it requires some knowledge of the use of a graphics program 
such as GIMP, Adobe Photoshop, or Paint Shop Pro. It is best done this 
way because it comes out its best, but this way takes time and effort 
to do, as well as ability to work the program. To do it this way 
in Adobe Photoshop, read our tutorial at:
http://anime.therisenrealm.com/pstutnarutotext.html

The second way is using an automated tool to make it. We have one we 
have created named NaruTxtGen. You can visit it at:
http://www.therisenrealm.com/?page=font_ninja_naruto

For Windows, you can install the font by going to the fonts folder 
(usually C:\WINDOWS\Fonts or C:\WINNT\Fonts) and going to File > 
Install New Font.

In the Ninja Naruto font, the letters N, A, R, U, T, and O are 
very similar to the original, but may differ a little, because I 
drew all the characters from scratch in Adobe Illustrator and 
assembled them in Font Creator.

If you think a letter should be improved or something or have 
comments, please add a comment on http://www.therisenrealm.com/?page=font_ninja_naruto
